# 🧠 DSA Code Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!

This repo contains a collection of DSA problems and solutions that I’ve worked on — all neatly written and organized in a single folder. It’s a handy reference for interview prep, coding practice, and concept revision.

## ✅ Topics Covered

The solutions span across a wide range of core DSA topics, including:

- Arrays
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs
- Linked Lists
- Maths
- Multiplication
- Number System
- Queues
- Recursion
- Searching
- Sorting
- Stacks
- Strings
- Trees

## 📌 Note

All files are placed directly in the main folder (not split into subfolders) for simplicity.  
The folder list above is just to help you understand the scope of topics included.

## 🚀 Why Use This Repo?

- Easy access to code across most common DSA topics  
- Helpful for placements and competitive coding  
- Constantly updated as I continue learning and practicing
